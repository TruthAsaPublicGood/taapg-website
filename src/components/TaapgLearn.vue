                  <p>Our mission is to gather a community around the technological foundations for truth as a public good. We do this through building and operating real world use cases initially around waste data.  From these experiences we will distil a protocol specification for all content authored by devices to the internet.  Think, <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let’s encrypt</a> for content authenticity.</p>
                  <p>For the 21st century Internet, technology can not be seen in isolation. Social and financial technology are becoming seamlessly intertwined and combined with the ever increasing capabilities of Artificial Intelligence (AI) software.  These trends apply to content authenticity and we will explore the commonwealth of cooperatives concept to govern and incentivise AI’s.</p>

Since October 2020, the Truth as a Public Good Working Group has been exploring the “dilemma” of standardized content and data authentication and the stakeholders involved in this decision-making ecosystem. Content authentication, evaluating the integrity of shared multimedia content, is crucial in the era of increasing erosion of the public’s trust in media and information sources

Waste as a Public Good - a technology experience that layers the principles of cooperativism, decentralized networks, and waste eradication -  is the flagship technology build of the <a href="https://www.mozillapulse.org/entry/1895"> Truth as a Public Good Working Group</a>. From January to MozFest 2022, this WG will host a series of iterative workshops anchored in a real-life material asset (a mutual aid van!) coalescing stakeholders within the developing ecosystems of Open Source Privacy Solutions (e.g., <a href="https://www.openmined.org/">OpenMined</a>) as well as Open Source Content Authentication (e.g., <a href="https://github.com/guardianproject/proofmode">Proofmode</a>) The aim of the MozFest roundtable will be to present our findings and prototype.

Background: Spurred by the excessive waste of furniture and home goods from wealthier urbanites fleeing lockdown during the Covid-19 pandemic, in Spring 2020 members of the [Washington] DC Mutual Aid Network organically developed a process to rehome these valuable material assets to under-resourced neighbors and community members. (See DC Mutual Aid Network - Transportation/Movement/Mobility Organizing <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18NyN8hphWuttGw-8W9Fj0FarMIX4PSvqS6-hinniSoQ/edit?usp=sharing">Document</a> ). Over the ensuing months, this effort mushroomed to include bulk trash removal companies, community members who were willing to use their trucks and personal vehicles on an ad hoc basis, logistics coordinators, and aligned other networks such as local Buy Nothing and Freecycle groups. Enter <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fyxRe5CBua8UR5WlHDpPxOIOIBptIu1M2G3JNhNwmQw/edit?usp=sharing">Billie the Van</a>.

Using Billie the Van, the TPG Working Group will use the months leading up to and during MozFest 2022 to build a prototype technology that will streamline a cooperative, circular economy business model where members of a Community can have decentralized access to the Collective’s resources: De-centralized Cooperatives - Waste as a Public Good.
